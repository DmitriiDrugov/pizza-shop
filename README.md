Known Issue
Currently, the "Home" link in GitHub Pages navigation points to a non-existent route.
Status: A fix is in progress.

Temporary workaround:
After opening the deployed app, click the pizza logo in the top-left corner to return to the home page.
⚠️ Do not refresh the page while on other sections — this may result in a 404 error due to GitHub Pages routing limitations.
